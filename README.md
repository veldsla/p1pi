p1pi
===

p1pi is is nodejs program to read, store and display the data from a P1 port which is used on most Dutch smart electricity meters.

The P1 port needs to be connected using a serial-to-USB cable. Stores the data in a sqlite db and produces some simple graphs using the HighCharts library.

I run this program on a Rasberry Pi, hence the name p1pi.

This is just test stuff, but it should work.
